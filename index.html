        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>AJ Durand began his yoga journey in 2003 at Yogaview in Chicago. He completed his first 200hr training in 2008 and his 2nd Level training in 2011 under the guidance of Quinn Kearney, Claire Mark, Geri Bleier and Tom Quinn. He began his focus for alignment oriented and therapeutic yoga in 2010 with Gabriel Halpern.  AJ is known most for his sense of humor, playfulness and his genuine enthusiasm while teaching.  He creates a casual but focused environment and he encourages you to ask questions, explore various techniques, and work your personal edge. He feels a distinct loyalty to his teachers and their encouragement to explore the multitudes of disciplines available.  </p>
 <p>
Now a New Orleanian and an active member of the LGBT+ community, AJ, who identifies as gender non-conforming, truly believes that self-care is community care. Trans* and gender variant folks always have a safe and supportive environment in which to practice in AJ’s class. With experience teaching everything from gentle/therapeutic yoga to rigorous athletic vinyasa he has a skillset that can be personally applied to any student’s level of experience and ability. He believes that the healing journey is one of self discovery and hopes to awaken the formless, genderless divine presence within each student and empower them to seek this source as their true teacher. 
 </p> <p>
He’s also a writer, performance artist, and might have an unhealthy obsession with ceramic cats. You can check out some of his musings on yoga, community and “not-knowing” by following his blog.
